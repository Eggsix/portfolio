				Hi! I'm Preston Phan. 27. born in texas and raised in the city of Seattle! 
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a full stack web developer front to back. I love building cool projects that I can be proud of. I spend quite a bit of time studying hipster web design layout and really hip background images. When I'm not web developing I am a gamer, snowboarder, swimmer, rock climber, tennis player and I work out at the gym on a dialy basis. I love all kinds of pets but mostly Yoshi my pet Lab/Pitbull.
